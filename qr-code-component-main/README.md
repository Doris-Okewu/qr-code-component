# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).  
I built this as part of my frontend development learning journey and to practice working with real-world projects.
